    "summary": "Naturally curious, discovery and learning are the essence of my daily work. I'm fond of challenges and I'm not afraid to fail. I'm autonomous, versatile, good teammate and pragmatic. Pedagogue, I taught algorithms and software engineering at IUT Paris Descartes, university of my cursus. I have many computer skills acquired during my studies or works. The majority of these skills have been tested and implemented in a professional environment. Performance is an obsession, industrialization a passion. Sport holds a special place in my schedule. Horse riding when I was younger, rowing, skiing and daily cycling for commuting.",
